# file.Static

Static marks the current file as static

Marking a file is equivalent to calling file.Skip, but instead file.Skip
is only called if the file already exists. This is useful for files you
want to generate but only once. It's generally recommended that you do
not do this as it limits your ability to change the file in the future.

```go
{{ file.Static }}
```
