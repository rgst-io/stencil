# stencil.ReadBlocks

ReadBlocks parses a file and attempts to read the blocks from it, and
their data.

As a special case, if the file does not exist, an empty map is returned
instead of an error.

> [!NOTE]
> This function does not guarantee that blocks are able to be
> read during runtime. For example, if you try to read the blocks of a
> file from another module there is no guarantee that that file will exist
> before you run this function. Nor is there the ability to tell stencil
> to do that (stencil does not have any order guarantees). Keep that in
> mind when using this function.

```go
{{- $blocks := stencil.ReadBlocks "myfile.txt" }}
{{- range $name, $data := $blocks }}
  {{- $name }}
  {{- $data }}
{{- end }}
```
