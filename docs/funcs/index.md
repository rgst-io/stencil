# Functions

Go templates are lightweight but extensible. Go itself supplies built-in functions, including comparison operators and other basic tools. These are listed in the [Go template documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#hdr-Functions). Stencil exposes more functions through [Sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) and itself.
