# stencil.GetGlobal

GetGlobal retrieves a global variable set by SetGlobal. The data
returned from this function is unstructured so by averse to panics -
look at where it was set to ensure you're dealing with the proper type
of data that you think it is.

```go
{{- /* This retrieves a global from the current context of the template module repository */}}
{{ $isGeorgeCool := stencil.GetGlobal "IsGeorgeCool" }}
```
