# Basic Stencil Module

> [!NOTE]
> This quick start assumes you're familiar with stencil usage already.
> If you aren't be sure to go through the [reference
> documentation](/reference/) or the [quick start](/guide/).

## Step 1: Create a module

Using the `stencil create` command we're able to quickly create a
module, let's start with a simple hello world module.

```bash
mkdir helloworld; cd helloworld
stencil create module github.com/yourorg/helloworld
```

You'll notice this created a `stencil.yaml` file and ran `stencil` on
itself. This isn't used now, but will be in the future.

Not created for you is the `templates/` directory. This is where your
templates will live.

## Step 2: Creating a Template

Let's create a template that creates a simple hello world message in Go.
We'll start by creating a `hello.go.tpl` in the `templates/` directory.

```go
package main

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

## Step 3: Consuming the Module in an Application

Now that we've done that, how do we test it locally without CI'ing up a
full build? This is super easy with the `replacements` map in a
[`stencil.yaml`](/reference/stencil.yaml).

Let's quickly create a test application:

```bash
mkdir testapp; cd testapp
cat >stencil.yaml <<EOF
name: testapp
modules:
  - name: github.com/yourorg/helloworld

replacements:
  # Replace ../helloworld with the path to your module.
  github.com/yourorg/helloworld: ../helloworld
EOF
```

Now if we run stencil on the test application, we should see the
following:

```bash
testapp ❯ stencil
INFO stencil 0.9.0
INFO Fetching dependencies
INFO  -> github.com/yourorg/helloworld local
INFO Loading native extensions
INFO Rendering templates
INFO Writing template(s) to disk
INFO   -> Created hello.go
INFO Running post-run command(s)
```

It looks like it created `hello.go` for us! Let's validate:

```bash
testapp ❯ cat hello.go
package main

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

:tada: We have a hello world application!

## Step 4: Using a Block

Blocks are incredibly easy to use in Stencil.

> [!NOTE]
> In case you don't remember, blocks are areas in your generated code
> that you'd like to persist across runs.

Let's create our own block in the hello.go template from earlier:

```go
package main

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello, world!")

  // <<Stencil::Block(additionalMessage)>>
  {{- /* It's important to not indent the file.Block to prevent the indentation from being copied over and.. over again. */ }}
{{ file.Block "additionalMessage" }}
  // <</Stencil::Block>>
}
```

If we re-run stencil and look at `hello.go` we should see the following:

```go
package main

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
  // <<Stencil::Block(additionalMessage)>>

  // <</Stencil::Block>>
}
```

If we add contents to the block and re-run stencil they'll be persisted
across the run!

## Step 5: (Optional/Advanced) Creating Multiple Files

One of the powerful parts of stencil is the ability to create an
arbitrary number of files with a single template. This is done with the
[`file.Create`](/functions/file.Create) function. Let's create a
`greeter.go.tpl` template in the `templates/` directory that'll create
`<greeting>.go` based on the `greetings` argument.

```go
# This is important! We do not want to create a greeter.go file
{{- $_ := file.Skip "Generates multiple files" }}

{{- define "greeter" -}}
{{- $greeting := .greeting }}
package main

func main() {
  fmt.Println("$greeting, world!")
}

{{- end -}}

{{- range $_, $greeting := stencil.Arg "greetings" }}

# Create a new $greeting.go file

{{- file.Create (printf "%s.go" $greeting) 0600 now }}

# We'll render the template greeter with $greeting as the values being passed to it

# Once we've done that we'll use the output to set the contents of the file we just created.

{{- stencil.ApplyTemplate "greeter" $greeting | file.SetContents }}
{{- end }}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Blocks are supported in multiple files! When `file.SetPath` is called
> the host is searched to see if a file already exists at that path, if
> it does it is searched to see if it contains any blocks, if it does
> they are loaded and accessible via `file.Block` as normal

Now let's modify the `manifest.yaml` to accept the argument `greetings`:

```yaml
arguments:
  greetings:
    description: A list of greetings to use
    required: true
    default: ["hello", "goodbye"]
    schema:
      type: arrary
```

If we now run stencil on the test application, we should see the following:

```bash
testapp ❯ stencil
INFO[0000] stencil v1.14.2
INFO[0000] Fetching dependencies
INFO[0002]  -> github.com/yourorg/helloworld local
INFO[0002] Loading native extensions
INFO[0002] Rendering templates
INFO[0002] Writing template(s) to disk
INFO[0002]   -> Created hello.go
INFO[0002]   -> Created goodbye.go
```

> [!NOTE] > `hello` and `goodbye` came from the default list of
> greetings that was set in the `manifest.yaml` file. Setting
> `arguments.greetings` on the test application and see it change!

If we look at the files, we should see the following:

```bash
testapp ❯ cat hello.go
package main

func main() {
  fmt.Println("hello, world!")
}

testapp ❯ cat goodbye.go
package main

func main() {
  fmt.Println("goodbye, world!")
}
```

## Reflection

We've created a module, used it in a test application via the
`replacements` map in the `stencil.yaml` and used a block. Optionally
we've also created multiple files with a template. This is just the
beginning of what you can do with modules. Modules have a rich amount of
[functions](/functions/) available to them. Check out the
[reference](/reference/) for more information about modules and how to
use them.
