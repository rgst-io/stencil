# Base Project

This section will walk you through building a nearly-empty stenciled project and teach you how blocks work. While the sample project here is very Golang-centric, stencil can be used for any language!

> [!NOTE]
> This quick start uses `macOS` in the examples. For instructions about how to install Stencil on other operating systems, see [install](installation.md).
> It is required to have [Git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to run this tutorial.

## Step 1: Install Stencil

If you don't already have stencil installed, follow the [documentation to install it](/guide/installation.html).

## Step 2: Create a `stencil.yaml`

First start by creating a new directory for your application, this should generally match whatever the name for your application is going to be. We'll go with `helloworld` here.

```bash
mkdir helloworld
```

A [stencil.yaml](/reference/stencil.yaml) is integral to running stencil. It defines the modules you're consuming and the arguments to pass to them.

Start with creating a basic `stencil.yaml`:

```yaml
name: helloworld
arguments: {}
# Below is a list of modules to use for this application
# It should follow the following format:
# - name: <moduleImportPath>
#   version: "optional-version-to-pin-to"
modules: []
```

Now run `stencil`, you should have... nothing! That's expected because we didn't define any modules yet.

```bash
helloworld ❯ stencil

INFO[0000] stencil v1.14.2
INFO[0002] Fetching dependencies
INFO[0002] Loading native extensions
INFO[0002] Rendering templates
INFO[0002] Writing template(s) to disk
INFO[0002] Running post-run command(s)

helloworld ❯ ls -alh
drwxr-xr-x 4 jaredallard wheel 128B May 4 20:16 .
drwxr-xr-x 9 jaredallard wheel 288B May 4 20:16 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 jaredallard wheel 213B May 4 20:16 stencil.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 jaredallard wheel 78B May 4 20:16 stencil.lock
```

> [!NOTE]
> You'll notice there's a `stencil.lock` file here.
>
> ```yaml
> version: v1.14.2
> generated: 2022-05-05T03:16:44.903458Z
> modules: []
> files: []
> ```
>
> This will keep track of what files were created by stencil and what created them, as well as the last ran version of your modules. This file is very important!

## Step 3: Import a Module

Now that we've created our first stencil application, you're going to want to import a module! Let's import the [`stencil-base`](https://github.com/getoutreach/stencil-base) module. stencil-base includes a bunch of scripts and other building blocks for a Golang project. Let's take a look at it's `manifest.yaml` to see what arguments are required.

```yaml
name: github.com/getoutreach/stencil-base
...
arguments:
description:
required: true
type: string
description: The purpose of this repository.
```

We can see that `description` is a required argument, so let's add it! Modify the `stencil.yaml` to set `arguments.description` to `"My awesome service!"`

```yaml
name: helloworld
arguments: {}
description: "My awesome service!"
modules:
  - name: github.com/getoutreach/stencil-base
```

Now if we run stencil we'll see that we have some files!

```bash
helloworld ❯ stencil
INFO[0000] stencil v1.14.2
INFO[0000] Fetching dependencies
INFO[0001]  -> github.com/getoutreach/stencil-base v0.2.0

```

# Step 4: Modifying a Block

One of the key features in stencil is the notion of "blocks". Modules expose a block where they want developers to modify the code. Let's look at the `stencil-base` module to see what blocks are available.

In `README.md` we can see a basic block called "overview":

```md
# helloworld

[![go.dev reference](https://img.shields.io/badge/go.dev-reference-007d9c?logo=go&logoColor=white)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/getoutreach/helloworld)
[![Generated via Stencil](https://img.shields.io/badge/Outreach-Bootstrap-%235951ff)](https://github.com/getoutreach/stencil)

My awesome service!

## Contributing

Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) document for guidelines on developing and contributing changes.

## High-level Overview

<!--- Block(overview) -->

<!--- EndBlock(overview) -->
```

Let’s add some content in two places. One inside the block, one outside:

```md
...

## High-level Overview

hello, world!

<!--- Block(overview) -->

hello, world!

<!--- EndBlock(overview) -->
```

If we re-run stencil, notice how the contents of `README.md` have changed:

```
...

## High-level Overview

<!--- Block(overview) -->

hello, world!

<!--- EndBlock(overview) -->
```

The contents of `README.md` have changed, but the contents within the block have not. This is the power of blocks, modules are able to change the content _around_ a user's content without affecting the user's content. This can be taken even further if a template decides to parse the code within a block at runtime, for example using the ast package to rewrite go code.

## Reflection

In all, we've created a `stencil.yaml`, added a module to it, ran stencil, and then modified the contents within a block. That's it! We've imported a base module and created some files, all without doing much of anything on our side. Hopefully that shows you the power of stencil.
