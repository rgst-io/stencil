# file.MigrateFrom

MigrateFrom parses blocks from the provided file as if they originated
from this template. This is useful when you want to move a file, but
keep its contents. This should be called before any other functions are
called inside of the file.

This function only takes effect if the old file (path) exists.

Note: Only blocks are persisted. Unlike [MigrateTo] the file is not
actually copied to disk.

**Example `old.go`:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

## <<Stencil::Block(main-function)>>
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from migrated code!")
}
## <</Stencil::Block>>
```

**Example `new.go.tpl`:**

```go
{{ file.MigrateFrom "old.go" -}}
package main

import "fmt"

## <<Stencil::Block(main-function)>>
{{ file.Block "main-function" }}
## <</Stencil::Block>>
```

**Example `new.go`:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

## <<Stencil::Block(main-function)>>
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from migrated code!")
}
## <</Stencil::Block>>
```

Result: The block content from old.go is preserved in new.go
