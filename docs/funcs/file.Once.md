# file.Once

Once will only generate this file a single time, if it doesn't already
exist, and store that fact in the stencil.lock file.

The first time a Once file is generated, it has its provenance stored in
the stencil.lock file. Going forward, Once checks the lock file for
history of the file, and if it finds it, it performs the same action as
file.Skip.

```go
{{- file.Once }}
```
