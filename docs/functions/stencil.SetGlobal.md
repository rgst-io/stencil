# stencil.SetGlobal

SetGlobal sets a global to be used in the context of the current
template module repository. This is useful because sometimes you want to
define variables inside of a helpers template file after doing manifest
argument processing and then use them within one or more template files
to be rendered; however, go templates limit the scope of symbols to the
current template they are defined in, so this is not possible without
external tooling like this function.

This template function stores (and its inverse, GetGlobal, retrieves)
data that is not strongly typed, so use this at your own risk and be
averse to panics that could occur if you're using the data it returns in
the wrong way.

```go
{{- /* This writes a global into the current context of the template module repository */}}
{{- stencil.SetGlobal "IsGeorgeCool" true -}}
```
