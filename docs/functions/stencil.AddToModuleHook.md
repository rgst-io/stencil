# stencil.AddToModuleHook

AddToModuleHook adds to a hook in another module

This functions write to module hook owned by another module for it to
operate on. These are not strongly typed so it's best practice to look
at how the owning module uses it for now. Module hooks must always be
written to with a list to ensure that they can always be written to
multiple times.

```go
{{- /* This writes to a module hook */}}
{{- stencil.AddToModuleHook "github.com/myorg/repo" "myModuleHook" (list "myData") }}
```
