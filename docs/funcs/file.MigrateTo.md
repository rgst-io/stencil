# file.MigrateTo

MigrateTo migrates the current file to a new path. If the old file
doesn't exist, it is treated as a `file.Skip`. If the old file still
exists, then it is moved to the new path (via a create and write, then
delete of the old path, not a filesystem move). If the MigrateTo target
file already exists, it is overwritten.

```go
{{- file.MigrateTo "new/path/to/file.txt" }}
```
